- Use of digital elevation data for `storm surge coastal flood modelling <https://un-spider.org/advisory-support/recommended-practices/dem-storm-surge-coastal-monitoring-airbus>`_ (UN-SPIDER).
- `Disaster preparedness <https://un-spider.org/advisory-support/recommended-practices/recommended-practice-disaster-preparedness-software-extensions/step-by-step-overview>`_ using free software extensions (UN-SPIDER).
- `Exposure Mapping <https://un-spider.org/advisory-support/recommended-practices/recommended-practice-exposure-mapping>`_ (UN-SPIDER).
