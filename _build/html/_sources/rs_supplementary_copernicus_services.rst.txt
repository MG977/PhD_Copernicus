Introduction to Copernicus Services
====================================
Copernicus is not only satellite images. It also collects information from many sensors on the ground, sea, and air and transforms all these data into useful information to monitor changes and create forecasts.

These value-added products are delivered to users through the six thematic Copernicus services:

- Atmosphere,
- Marine,
- Land,
- Climate change,
- Security,
- Emergency,

|br|

Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service
`````````````````````````````````````````
The `Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service <https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/>`_ provides data and information on atmospheric composition. It describes the current situation, forecasts a few days ahead, and analyses consistently retrospective data records for recent years. 

For example, the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service provides daily information on the global atmospheric composition by monitoring and forecasting constituents such as greenhouse gases, reactive gases, ozone and aerosols. The service also delivers information on the solar radiation at the Earth’s surface (which is essential for health, agriculture and renewable energies), near-real-time analysis, 4-day forecasts, and reanalysis of the European air quality.

Overall, the service focuses on five main areas:

- Air quality and atmospheric composition,
- Ozone layer and ultra-violet radiation,
- Emissions and surface fluxes,
- Solar radiation,
- Climate forcing.

Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service
`````````````````````````````````````````````````
The `Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service <https://marine.copernicus.eu/>`_ provides regular and systematic information on the physical and biogeochemical state, variability and dynamics of the ocean and marine ecosystems.

For example, the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service improves ship routing services, offshore operations or search and rescue operations. The service also contributes to the protection and sustainable management of living marine resources. And the physical and biogeochemical components are useful for water quality monitoring, pollution control, or coastal erosion assessment.

Overall, the service focuses on four main areas:

- Marine safety,
- Marine resources,
- Coastal and marine environment,
- Weather, seasonal forecasting and climate.

Copernicus Land Monitoring Service
````````````````````````````````````
The `Copernicus Land Monitoring Service <https://land.copernicus.eu/>`_ provides geographical information on land cover and its changes, land use, vegetation state, water cycle and Earth’s surface energy variables.

For example, the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service supports applications such as spatial and urban planning, forest management, water management, agriculture and food security, nature conservation and restoration, rural development, ecosystem accounting and mitigation/adaptation to climate change.

Overall, the service focuses on five main areas:

- The systematic monitoring of biophysical parameters,
- Land cover and land use mapping,
- Thematic hot-spot mapping,
- Imagery and reference data,
- European ground motion activity.

|br|

Copernicus Climate Change Service
````````````````````````````````````
The `Copernicus Climate Change Service <https://climate.copernicus.eu/>`_ provides information about the past, present and future climate in Europe and the rest of the World.

For example, The Copernicus Climate Change Service provides scientists, consultants, planners, policymakers, media and the general public free and open access to climate data and tools to assess climate change impacts on biodiversity.

Copernicus Security Service
````````````````````````````
The `Copernicus Security Service <https://climate.copernicus.eu/>`_ provides information in response to Europe’s security challenges.

For example, the Copernicus Security Service supports the reduction of illegal immigrants’ death at sea, increases the European Union’s internal security, and fights against cross-border crime. It also increases navigation safety, supports fisheries control, combats marine pollution, and law enforcement at sea. Besides, the Copernicus Security Service provides decision-makers with geo-information on remote and difficult to access areas, where security issues are at stake.

Overall, the service focuses on three main areas:

- Border surveillance,
- Maritime surveillance,
- Support to EU external action.

.. _Copernicus-Emergency-Management-Service:

Copernicus Emergency Management Service
````````````````````````````````````````
The `Copernicus Emergency Management Service <https://emergency.copernicus.eu/>`_ provides all actors involved in managing natural disasters, man-made emergency situations, and humanitarian crises with timely and accurate satellite-based geospatial information completed by available on-site data or open data sources.

For example, the Copernicus Emergency Management Service provides digital and printed maps to Civil Protection Authorities and Humanitarian Aid Agencies. Map products can support all the phases of the emergency management cycle: preparedness, prevention, disaster risk reduction, emergency response and recovery.

Overall, the service focuses on two main areas (and four systems):

- The mapping component,
- The early warning component:

- The European Flood Awareness System, which provides overviews on ongoing and forecasted floods in Europe up to 10 days in advance,
- The European Forest Fire Information System, which provides near real-time and historical information on forest fires and forest fire regimes in the European, Middle Eastern and North African regions,
- The European Drought Observatory, which provides drought-relevant information and early-warnings for Europe,
- Global Flood Awareness System, Global Wildfire Information System and Global Drought Observatory complete the previous three systems globally.
